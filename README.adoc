== Operational Systems Notebook ==

=== Description ===
This is a project containing notes from university classes about operational systems. It is mostly scratches and standalone code snippets, which is dedicated to study several concepts about operational systems.

Each task has its own main() function so every task would have its own executable file.

The naming of files is inconsistent because the tasks in the course was not always of the same kind.

One great part of the task is a development of a shell, which in my case is called https://github.com/GrindelfP/gshell-light[GShellLight] and stored in its own repository.

The description of each task is provided in link:task-list.adoc[task list].
